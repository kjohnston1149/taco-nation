        <h3>Not your Regular Taco</h3>
        <p>Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins. CARNE ASADA!! It’s taco Tuesday Monday. You see, the refried beans are really just the adhesive necessary to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell. Tacos, tacos, tacos. You see, the refried beans are really just the adhesive necessary to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell. Add in a few el Pastor with guac and diced onions.</p>

        <p>Does guac cost extra? TACOS!! I think I’ve overdosed on tacos. I’ve been following that taco truck around all day. Tacos Al pastor/De Adobada are made of thin pork steaks seasoned with adobo seasoning, then skewered and overlapped on one another on a vertical rotisserie cooked and flame-broiled as it spins. Black or pinto beans? Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp.</p>

        <p>You see, the refried beans are really just the adhesive necessary to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell. Add in a few el Pastor with guac and diced onions. Give me all the tacos, immediately. Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you have any Cholula? Fish tacos with cabbage slaw and a side of chips and guac. Tacos, again? This will be 5 times this week and it’s only Tuesday. Tacos dorados called flautas, or taquitos, for which the tortillas are filled with pre-cooked shredded chicken, beef or barbacoa, rolled into an elongated cylinder and deep-fried until crisp.</p>
